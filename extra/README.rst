Extra Stuff
===========

This directory is destined to be a place for various stuff.  It may
contain experimental code to explore some ideas or proof of concept
implementations for new features.  Or it may be broken fragments of
something that didn't turn out to be useful.

*Note*: the stuff in this directory unmaintained.  It is not supposed
to be part of the `archive-tools` package and is not included in the
distribution.  Nothing is stable here.  There is no documentation.  It
may be incompatible with the current version of the package.  It may
or may not work at all.

Obviously, some bits and pieces may get resurrected later on and moved
out of this directory to become a part of a future version of the
package.
